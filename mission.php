            <p>&#8220;Go Hard or Go Home&#8221; is a great thing to print on our shirts, merchandise and posters to really motivate people, but it is truly not all that Alpha 7 Seas is about. We cater to everyone, any effort expelled in our gym is always a reward unto itself and you&#8217;ll never feel like you need to go home or be told you didn&#8217;t go hard enough, we are always happy that you turned up to sweat beside the rest of us. </p>
            <p>So with that in mind, our true Alpha 7 Seas mission statement, or vision if you will, is written below.</p>
