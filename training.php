            <h2>Mixed Martial Arts</h2>
            <p>MMA stands for mixed martial arts. That is exactly what our MMA striking class represents. It is the fusion of striking martial arts put together into a hybrid dynamic striking style. We do not believe there is one “best” style. Some ideas and concepts that we use to build our style are taken from Boxing, Muay Thai, and some traditional martial arts. Partnering up and working on combos, defense, counters, footwork, and forms through drills and padwork is the main channel of learning in class.
